# Final_Project

### Part A - Overview::
Our project involved creating an information system for a digital brokerage services company. Here's what we accomplished:

1. ER Diagram:
We designed a detailed ER diagram using tools like draw.io to model the data effectively.

2. SQL Commands:
We developed CREATE TABLE statements to build the database structure based on the ER diagram, ensuring the correct data types and constraints for each table.

3. Views and Queries:
We created SQL views to simplify complex queries and improve data retrieval efficiency.

Some of the challenges we faced included ensuring the ER diagram accurately reflected the required relationships and constraints and writing efficient SQL commands to handle large datasets and complex queries.

The key takeaways from this project were gaining a thorough understanding of database design and management, improving our skills in writing and optimizing SQL queries, and enhancing our ability to model complex data relationships effectively.

This project was an amazing learning experience. It provided practical insights into database management and reinforced the importance of well-structured data systems.

We're looking forward to the next phase of the project and cannot wait to continue developing these skills!



### Part B - Overview:
